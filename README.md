# IEEE 754 Converter GUI 🖩

A Java Swing application that converts between decimal and binary floating-point representations based on the IEEE 754 double-precision format. Built as part of a university Object-Oriented Programming course to demonstrate GUI development, binary logic, and real-time data processing.

## 📌 Features

- 🔢 Convert decimal floats and integers to 64-bit IEEE 754 binary
- 💻 Convert IEEE 754 binary strings back to decimal
- 🧮 Displays the sign bit (positive/negative) of the input
- 🎛️ Customizable decimal precision
- ⌨️ Supports both keyboard and on-screen button input
- ❌ Error messages for invalid entries
- 📐 Clean, intuitive graphical layout with interactive buttons
