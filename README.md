# IEEE 754 Converter GUI Calculator 🖩

A Java Swing application that converts between decimal and binary floating-point representations based on the IEEE 754 double-precision format. Built as part of a university Object-Oriented Programming coursework project to demonstrate GUI development, binary logic, and real-time data processing.

## 📌 Features

- 🔢 Convert decimal floats and integers to 64-bit IEEE 754 binary
- 💻 Convert IEEE 754 binary strings back to decimal
- ➕ Displays the sign bit (positive/negative) of the input
- 🎯 Customizable decimal precision
- ⌨️ Supports both keyboard and on-screen button input
- ❌ Error handling for invalid entries
- 🎨 Clean and user-friendly GUI
